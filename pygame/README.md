This game is basically the demonstration from class. 
The Death Star is able to move all around the screen using the arrow keys, and can fire its lasers by clicking the mouse. Unlike the example from class, this Death Star can aim while shooting, so it is not locked in a position when shooting. This was an intentional feature, because it was cool to see the lasers able to spin around.

You can press the 'r' key to reset the game state.
