For this assignment I used PyQt to create a front-end interface for the Python web server. It displays the recommended movies for a particular user.

In order to see the user information, click on User->View Profile.
In order to change the user, click on User->Set User, and then enter the user ID of the user you want to change to.

To exit the program, click File->Exit
